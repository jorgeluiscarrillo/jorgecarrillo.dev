title: "üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me"
---

I grew up in Los Angeles county. Throughout high-school, I participated in one of the most well-recognized marching bands in Southern California. Growing up, I've always been interested in computers and tech. This led me to major in Computer Science at California State University, Long Beach. During my education, I worked with students to develop Android mobile apps. Around the time Windows 10 released, I discovered Linux and the open-source software community. This discovery led to a shift in my career path from being development focused to more IT focused. My current goal is to use the skills I have taught myself to be able to work as a DevOps or Site Reliability Engineer.
